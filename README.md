Really bad git puns only


# Setting Up Git

1.Install Git for whatever host machine you are on: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
2.Simply sign up for github.com account make sure its github, there is also gitlab which are different.  
3.Open up gitbash.exe in admin mode. You will NEVER EVER use the git GUI because you will usually work in a linux environment(git bash uses linux commands to navigate so be careful 'rm * -rf' is not a fun command) and also the git GUI is vile. This will get you used to linux at the same time as using git.  
4.Set up an SSH key for your github account. I am not posting a link, I will leave this up to yous.  
5.Set up your global email and global username inside gitbash. Again will lets yous figure this out.  
6.You can now clone repo's. Again use git bash to do it(you can use cmdprompt also but its ugly and doesn't use linux commands)  
  
# CAREFUL: whatever directory you are in, is what directory the project will be cloned in to.  
  
# Common Practices  
  
1.NEVER EVER EVER work on the master branch.  
2.Each one of you needs to create a branch off of master. I want everyone working on their own branch.  
3.Usually these are known as 'feature' branches. so your branch name should be 'feature/what_ever_you_are_working_on'  

# The Task  
  
# Really I don't care about any code you write in this. This isn't for flexing your java skills(though please do go ahead and do that). I want everyone to create a new class(a new file rather than appending all classes onto main.java) on their OWN BRANCH! From there just start coding away, commit changes and push them up to your branch. This next part is overkill but for EVERY SINGLE FUNCTION create a new branch and once that function is written: commit, push and create a merge request to master and then create a new feature branch for your new function.  
  
# And remember to have fun. Dab after every function if needs be. Enjoy, and please message me directly on FB or Whatsapp if you really get stuck. P.S I want to see yous break this repo trying to get stuff to work before coming to me.
